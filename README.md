# Drawee

This is a collaborative whiteboard I built using Nextjs and Typescript. It uses liveblocks for the collaborative features. 

Here's what you can do -

- Draw using the following supported tools:
  - Circle
  - Rectangle
  - Text
- Select any shape/element and move it.
- Resize shapes like rectangle.
- Undo/Redo at any point.



So just create a room and share the link with your mate to start collaborating!


TODO:
1. Add more shapes like arrow.
2. Show user's name on their cursor.
3. Add join room functionality.
4. Add unit tests.
